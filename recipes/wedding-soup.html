            <p class="soup-des"><em>Turkish wedding soup,</em> called düğün çorbası, not to be mistaken for Turkish bride’s soup (ezorbelin çorbası), traditionally is served at weddings, but is an easy yet elegant meal for any occasion. This version is based on a recipe from Istanbul home cook Emine Nese Daglar, grandmother of chef Cagla Gurses. Lamb neck is the classic choice for Turkish wedding soup; we use easy-to-source shanks instead; if you prefer, beef shank works nicely, too. The shanks are simmered for a couple of hours, yielding a flavorful broth as a soup base, as well as shredded meat for stirring before serving. To lend a velvety feel, the soup is enriched at the finish with a combination of flour, yogurt and egg, and lemon juice is added for a little brightness. And as a final flourish, a garlicky, Aleppo pepper–infused oil and fresh herbs garnish individual bowlfuls.</p>

            <h1 class="directions">Directions</h1>
            <ol class="directions">
                <li>In a large saucepan, combine the lamb shank, onion, the halved carrot, 2 teaspoons salt and 3 quarts water. Bring to a simmer over medium-high, occasionally skimming off and discarding any foam that rises to the surface. Reduce to medium and simmer, uncovered, until a skewer inserted into the meat meets no resistance, 2 to 2½ hours.</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, combine the oil, Aleppo pepper and garlic. Cook over medium, stirring, until the oil begins to bubble and turn red, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and cool for about 30 minutes. Strain the oil mixture through a fine-mesh sieve set over a liquid measuring cup or small bowl; discard the solids and set the oil aside.</li>
                <li>When the lamb is done, transfer it to a large plate. Using a slotted spoon, remove and discard the carrot and onion from the broth. Add the chopped carrot and potato to the broth, bring to a simmer over medium and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender, 12 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, shred the lamb into bite-sized pieces, discarding the bone and any gristle. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
                <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, yogurt, lemon juice and egg until well combined. Remove a ladleful of the hot broth from the pan and, while whisking constantly, drizzle it into the flour-yogurt mixture to temper it. Repeat with another ladleful of hot broth. Whisk the mixture into the broth, then stir in the shredded meat. Bring to a gentle simmer over medium, stirring constantly, until heated through and lightly thickened, about 2 minutes; do not allow the soup to boil. Remove the pan from the heat.</li>
                <li>Stir in half each of the dill, mint and parsley. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. Serve the soup sprinkled with the remaining herbs and drizzled with the infused oil.</li>
